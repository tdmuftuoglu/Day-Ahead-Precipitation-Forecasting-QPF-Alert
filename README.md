Day-Ahead Precipitation Forecasting: QPF + Alert
This repository provides an explainable two-stage machine learning pipeline for day-ahead precipitation forecasting in Köyceğiz, Turkey, utilizing a 24-year archive of NASA POWER daily meteorological data (2001–2024).

Stage 1 (Regression): An optimized CatBoost model for Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF).

Stage 2 (Classification): A LightGBM model for extreme-event alerting, rigorously defined by the 95th-percentile threshold (15.24 mm/day).

The pipeline strictly preserves operational causality by utilizing lagged features (t−1, t−3, t−7) and avoids data leakage. It delivers highly accurate and calibrated performance, achieving a test R² of 0.837 for regression and an F1-score of 0.752 (AUC = 0.989) for extreme event classification.

Key Features
High Accuracy QPF: The CatBoost regressor effectively captures daily precipitation variability, achieving an R² = 0.837 and RMSE = 2.414 mm on the hold-out test set.

Robust Extreme-Event Alerts: The dedicated LightGBM classifier successfully addresses class imbalance, providing reliable early warnings with an F1-score = 0.752 and AUC = 0.989.

Physical Explainability: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis ensures model transparency, revealing that land surface characteristics (soil moisture) and relative humidity are the primary drivers of precipitation.

Full Reproducibility: A single Google Colab notebook provides an end-to-end automated workflow to reproduce all models, figures, and tables.

How to Reproduce the Paper
The entire dual-task workflow is fully automated in a provided Google Colab notebook.

Open in Colab: Open the provided KoycegizPrecipExtended.ipynb notebook file in Google Colab.

Run All: In the Colab interface, navigate to the top menu and select Runtime → Run all.

Automatic Execution: The notebook will automatically execute the following steps:

Download and preprocess the NASA POWER daily meteorology dataset (2001-2024).

Generate the 51-dimensional multivariate feature space, including 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day lagged variables.

Perform chronological train/test splitting (80/20) to prevent information leakage.

Train and optimize the CatBoost QPF regressor.

Train and evaluate the LightGBM extreme-event classifier using the operational 95th-percentile threshold (15.24 mm/day).

Calculate performance metrics (R², RMSE, MAE, MSE, F1, Precision, Recall, AUC).

Generate and export all diagnostic plots, including Time Series, Scatter Plots, Seasonal R² performance, Confusion Matrices, and SHAP summary plots.
